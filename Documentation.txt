Welcome, before trying to run the executable file, you must install a couple libraries using PIP.
The user must also have python installed along with pyinstaller in order to run pip install commands in terminal.

Install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/, and make sure to check/click pyinstaller in the setup application.
Install pygame using "pip install pygame"


Also make sure to download all the image files and all the python files.
Make sure all the files are located in the same folder.
