Welcome, before trying to run the executable file, you must install a couple of libraries using PIP.
The user must also have python installed along with pyinstaller in order to run pip install commands in the terminal.

Install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/, and make sure to check/click pyinstaller in the setup application.
Install pygame using "pip install pygame"


Also, make sure to download all the image files and all the python files.
Make sure all the files are located in the same folder.

Functionality:
	Introduction Screen
	- The user uses the up and down keys to scroll through the different pages: start, controls, and leaderboard
	- The user uses the space bar to open each page
	- The start page starts the game
	- The controls page opens the game's controls, use r to return to the select screen
	- The leaderboard page opens a text file that holds the names and times of past players, hit the x to exit the leaderboard
	
	Game 1
	- A remake of Pong
  	- The user uses the up and down keys to control the paddle
  	- The enemy paddle tracks the ball by constantly going to its location
  	- Every time the ball hits a paddle its speed increases
	- If the ball goes past the user's paddle the game restarts and returns to the home screen
	- If the ball goes past the enemy's paddle the game transitions to game 2
	- Use r to restart and return to the home screen

	Game2
	- A remake of Breakout
	- The user uses the space key to start the game
  	- The user uses the right and left keys to control the paddle
  	- If the ball hits a brick it deletes the brick
  	- If the ball goes past the paddle the game restarts and returns to the home screen
	- If the ball hits the top of the screen the game transitions to game 3
	- Use r to restart and return to the home screen

	Game 3
	- A remake of Pac-man
  	- The user uses all the arrow keys to move the character
  	- The ghosts move back and forth across the screen continuously
  	- If the user eats all the white squares the game ends and enter the win screen where it displays the time and where the user can enter their initials
	- If the user comes in contact with the ghost the game restarts and returns to the home screen
	- Use r to restart and return to the home screen

How does it work?
	Our program uses pygame which has certain functions that make the game design in python easier. Pygame can detect key presses which are used to move the x and y values of images or the characters. Pygames sprites work by displaying the image. If the user wants to move the sprite a background image covers the old sprite and a new sprite is displayed.
